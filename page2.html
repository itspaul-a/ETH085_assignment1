    <h4><b>Section: I Mind</b></h4>
    <p>Quote: De donde eres?</p>
    <p>After listening to the words of Maestra Grace Sesma In her keynote my mind is filled with ideas of where I fit in the world. With the question “de donde eres?” Maestra Sesma starts the conversation of who are the ancestors that you derive from and how do you fit into the world with this reality. This question also poses the idea that a person should know about there ancestry and who came before them.

    <h4><b>Section: II Body</b></h4>
    <p>Quote: Our roots are ancient</p>
    <p>The quote “our roots are ancient” places tension on my body that was almost like a weight. The reason for this is that through listening to this be told I am reminded that I lack a great deal of knowledge about who came before me. My family being from chile, while I may have some understanding about the  chile and the people of today I am very ignorant about the people that first inhabited the land.

    <h4><b>Section: III Emotion</b></h4>
    <p>Quote: There is a need for many nations to come together</p>
    <p>The belief that “there is a need for many nations to come together” presented the feeling of frustration and pleasure. The reason for frustration is that the topic is a very difficult one to have a conversation about. Simply offering the idea of strong borders is seen as a racist remark making it difficult to make any advancements in the conversation. The reason that I felt pleasure was due to the quote being aligned with my personal beliefs. This made what I was hearing to be a pleasurable experience as I too agree in uniting nations. </p>

    <h4><b>Section: IV Spirit</b></h4>
        <p>Quote: The lands were stolen from us</p>
    <p>Personally I trust my intuition and gut feelings to a certain extent. While I dont have complete trust in myself as I believe this can place you in an echochamber I do believe that the information I have obtained is correct and can be used to make evaluations on my life.While I do recall my dreams I do not believe that they are reference guides to anything. The reason for this is due to the advancements made in understanding dreams. We now understand that dreams are a way for the mind to recall what was experienced throughout the day in order to make long term memories. These advancements show that these are the purpose for dreams not to gain some form of guidance.
